----->If you don't want to loop through huge chunk of text files, head over to ./src/DAAFinal.cpp, scroll to the main function and comment the lines that has "//" essentially removing for loops and other helper variables that was created to iterate through folders and subfolers



----->If you want to test the polygon decomposition on a single image use: decomm.py



----->"report" folder contains the HTML report page



----->index.html inside "doc" folder contains the doxygen documentation
